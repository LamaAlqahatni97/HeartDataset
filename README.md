# HeartDataset
The datasets are processed in python programming using some seven machine learning algorithms, namely SVM, 
K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest and Na√Øve Bayes. The experiment outcomes showed that Multi-layer Perceptron
had achieved the highest performance up to 91% and all the classifiers accuracy results improved after applying 
brute force technique.
